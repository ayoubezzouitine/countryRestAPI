# 🌍 Spring Boot REST API - Country Data Processor

This project is a **Spring Boot REST API** that fetches **country data** from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all), processes large datasets efficiently using **parallelStream()**, and provides endpoints to filter and transform country data.

It demonstrates the use of **Spring Boot, RestTemplate, Java Streams, and Lombok** to handle external API data and optimize performance for large-scale processing.
